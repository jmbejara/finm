    "### 🔹 Bond Selection Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exclude bonds** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Floating rate coupons**\n",
    "  * **Non-callable option features** (e.g., puts, convertibles). However, callable bonds are retained due to their prevalence in historical data.\n",
    "* **Price filters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Remove observations where the **corporate bond price exceeds** the price of its matched Treasury.\n",
    "  * Drop observations where price < **\\$0.01 per \\$1 face value**.\n",
    "* **Return reversals**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Eliminate both return observations if the **product of adjacent returns is < -0.04**, suggesting a data entry error or extreme correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Data Sources Used\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combined data from:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Lehman Brothers Fixed Income Database**\n",
    "  * **Mergent FISD/NAIC Database**\n",
    "  * **TRACE**\n",
    "  * **DataStream**\n",
    "* Defaults are verified and completed using **Moody's Default Risk Service**.\n",
    "* **CRSP** and **Compustat** are used to supplement with equity and accounting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Synthetic Treasury Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each corporate bond, a **synthetic Treasury bond** with an identical cash flow structure is constructed.\n",
    "* Treasury prices are based on **Federal Reserve constant-maturity yield data**.\n",
    "* This enables clean computation of **excess returns** and **credit spreads**, expressed in **price terms** rather than yield spreads, to maintain linearity and reduce approximation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Additional Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "* Callable bonds are retained and accounted for using **fixed effects** in regression models (callability has minor pricing impact, \\~9 bps).\n",
    "* The study uses **monthly returns**, avoiding the need for reinvestment assumptions.\n"
